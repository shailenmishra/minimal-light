## About Me

I am a creative writer, writing studies scholar, and educator.  I am currently a visiting faculty at Swarthmore College. I have close to twenty years of teaching experience in a range of higher-ed institutions and in a range of writing courses/genres. Notably, I have taught at esteemed institutions such as North Carolina State University, Illinois State University, University of Delaware, and Swarthmore College. I also have experience tutoring writing to high-school and middle-school students. I am always curious to grow as a writer, researcher, and educator. And I attend to my students' learning needs with a great deal of empathy.


## My Strengths as a Teacher/Tutor

**Experience**: I have worked with numerous students from different backgrounds and with varied writing skills/interests. I respect differences and I don't minimize a student's unique learning needs. In fact, I have learned how to be an encouraging and helpful teacher to a diverse range of students.

**Empathy**: I take pride in being a caring educator. Research shows that a teacher's welcoming and caring demeanor can let students feel valued. Additionally, in students' evaluation of my teaching, a frequent praise that I have received was that I offer a great deal of individual attention and care to students when they are feeling stressed about an assignment. 

**Scholarship**: Since I am a writing studies scholar, I actively read and write about writing issues from a scholarly and at times scientific standpoint. My approach to teaching is backed by research and evidence of what works and does not work in writing and teaching of writing.  

**Big Picture Stuff**: I prioritize teaching writing through broader conceptual frameworks rather than focusing on micro aspects of writing such as grammar, punctuation, and mechanics of writing (sure, I will address them only when I see a pattern). The broader concepts such as genre, audience, rhetorical context, exigency, and discourse community can help students ask deeper questions like why a particular writing assignment is asking them to write in a certain way, what's the purpose, what ideas are effectively communicated and how, etc. Learning such big picture stuff makes students more independent and adaptable thinkers. They see the larger value of writing than thinking of it as a chore or a task to complete for grade. 

**Diversity**: I am a multilingual writer and speaker. I learned English as my third language and this is the primary language in which I teach writing now. I strongly believe that a student's linguistic identity, influenced by their cultural background, multilingualism, and identity, can be a source of strength. I believe in [linguistic justice](https://criminal-justice.ecu.edu/wp-content/pv-uploads/sites/72/2023/03/Linguistic-Justice.pdf) and empowering my students to learn and develop their own voice and linguistic identity. 


## We Won’t Be a Good Match If…

- Your priorities are grade-specific. I understand that grades are important but I prefer keeping a long-term and holistic focus in mind when teaching writing, which means letting go of grade concerns sometimes.
- You measure writing largely from the lens of grammatical and idiomatic accuracy. While these aspects can be important depending on the context, writing is much more than such local concerns. 
- You want me to catch and point out every error in your writing. Countless research shows that such a time-consuming endeavor has a very low ratio of benefit for a novice writer. More critically though, such a proverbial "bloodbath" can easily turn off a writer and dent their confidence for good. I tend to be selective with my feedback, and as I have said above, I keep in mind the "big picture stuff." Students find the learning process manageable that way and they make powerful progress in time.
- You're looking for a quick fix. Writing is a _process_. Like every other discipline, writing takes years to get good at and find confidence in. And in the meantime, we need to take learning for what it needs to be: a thing to value, enjoy, and celebrate.
